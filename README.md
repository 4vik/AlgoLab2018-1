# Algorithms Lab 2018
This repo contains my solutions to the algorithms lab of ETH ZÃ¼rich. The lab consists of problems every week that must be solved via an algorithm. 

The primary language to solve the challenges is C++. I strive as much as possible to document my code and my algorithms. The description of the problems may be wonky, so I suggest that you give the associated PDF a read for a detailed explanation of the problem.

## Compilation and Running
To compile the cpp files:
```bash
g++ -Wall -O3 filename.cpp -o filename.o
```

To run the file with a given input and redirect output to a file
```bash
./filename.o < testsets/test{i}.in > test{i}.out
```

To compare with the expected output, use `diff`
```bash
diff test{i}.out testsets/test{i}.out
```

Alternatively, you can do the previous in one line
```bash
diff <(./filename.o < testsets/test{i}.in) testsets/test{i}.out
```
